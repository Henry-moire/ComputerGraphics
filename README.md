# Massive Dataset by Amazon
This project's goal is to efficiently process a large dataset by creating language-specific files like en-xx.xlsx for various languages, including English, Swahili and German. It will also generate separate JSONL files for training, testing and development data in these languages. Furthermore, it will produce a single JSON file containing translations from English to all languages, focusing on handling the dataset efficiently without resorting to recursive algorithms to prevent memory and time complexity problems.
